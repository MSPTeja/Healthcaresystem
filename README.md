# Healthcaresystem
Problem statement :
How can you help Sunita Sharma (65+ years old) to live a healthier and better life?
Identify one use case for elderly care (for the age group65+) and create a working prototype to demonstrate your idea using technology known to you.

My solution:
I have created a application which stores all the information about existing diseases,Medicines currently using etc, which is very useful for
both patient and for the Doctor to know about the previous diagnosis and diseases. It will not only help the old people,it also helps the doctors
a lot. Now a days carrying reports and carrying them is not so easy task. Instead if we create a eco-system where it stores all the patient
information right from diagnosis reports, Medicines to any allergic conditions. This especially very useful incase emergencies when nobody is there
to tell about your diseases these type of systems might help a lot.

tech stack used:
Java,JDBC,MYSQL.

Limitations:
Due to lack some resources and time I implemented only 3 areas of problems. we can improve this project by adding scanning reports,allergies etc.
